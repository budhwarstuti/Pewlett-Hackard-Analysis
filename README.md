* A total of 90398 people are going to be retiring very soon from Pewlett-Hackard.

* There are relatively less Technical leaders, Assistant Engineers and Managers retiring.

##  **Summary**
* With about 90390 people retiring and just 1549 people eligble for mentorship program, Pewlett-Harchard is going to have to start a vigourous interview process to fill in for the people who are going to retire.
* Based on the table provided above for the vacancies that are going to be created for all positions, it might be a good idea to also have a mentorship programme to prepare the existing employees for those positions also which might save the time & effort for interview process.
* There could also be new positions created to bridge between the current employee position and new position that just got vacated; until the employee attains the ability to take up the tasks/responsibilities for the new position.
